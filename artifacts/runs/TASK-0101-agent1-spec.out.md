OPEN-011 is already resolved in the RFC/DEC and SSOT, so I only recorded this re-verify and CI result in the task run log.

- Updated `artifacts/runs/TASK-0101-agent1-spec.out.md` with the re-verify note and `./ci.sh` status.
- Reviewed `docs/rfc/RFC-0005-notification-minimal-set.md`, `docs/rfc/DEC-0005-notification-minimal-set.md`, `docs/constitution/15_behavior_spec.md`, `docs/constitution/10_core_fact_spec.md`, and `docs/constitution/80_risks.md`; no edits required.

**Tests**
- `./ci.sh` (green)

FYI: `artifacts/runs/TASK-0200-agent4-ci.out.md` was already modified and left untouched.

Next steps:
1. Commit the updated run log if you want this verification recorded.
