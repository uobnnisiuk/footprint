No doc edits needed; OPEN-011 is already resolved in spec and RFC/DEC per SR, so I only re-verified and ran CI.

- Reviewed `docs/rfc/RFC-0005-notification-minimal-set.md`, `docs/rfc/DEC-0005-notification-minimal-set.md`, `docs/constitution/15_behavior_spec.md`, `docs/constitution/10_core_fact_spec.md`, `docs/constitution/80_risks.md`.
- Run log `artifacts/runs/TASK-0101-agent1-spec.out.md` already reflects the verification; left unchanged.
- Tests: `./ci.sh` (green).

I noticed modified tracked files I didn’t touch: `ci.sh`, `artifacts/runs/TASK-0200-agent4-ci.out.md`. How would you like me to proceed with those?
