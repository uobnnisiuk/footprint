Updated the TASK-0101 run log with the actual `./ci.sh` output after confirming OPEN-011 was already resolved in the SSOT; no spec edits were needed.

- Logged verification and CI output in `artifacts/runs/TASK-0101-agent1-spec.out.md` for traceability.
- Confirmed DEC-0005 references already align in `docs/constitution/15_behavior_spec.md`, `docs/constitution/10_core_fact_spec.md`, and `docs/constitution/80_risks.md`.

Tests: `./ci.sh`

I noticed existing uncommitted changes I didn’t make in `ci.sh`, `artifacts/runs/TASK-0102-agent5-acceptance.out.md`, and `artifacts/runs/TASK-0200-agent4-ci.out.md`, plus untracked tasks in `artifacts/inbox/tasks/TASK-0310-agent2-spike-0003-ios.md`, `artifacts/inbox/tasks/TASK-0311-agent3-spike-0003-android.md`, and `artifacts/inbox/tasks/TASK-0312-agent2-spike-0003-runbook-analysis.md`. How would you like me to proceed with those?
