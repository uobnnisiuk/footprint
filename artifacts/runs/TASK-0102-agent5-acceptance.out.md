I checked `docs/constitution/30_testplan.md` and TST-0012 is already present with the required fields and forbidden items plus the grep command, so the requested change appears done. How would you like to proceed?

1) Leave as-is and mark the task done  
2) Adjust the wording/command (tell me what to change)  
3) Run `./ci.sh` to verify green
