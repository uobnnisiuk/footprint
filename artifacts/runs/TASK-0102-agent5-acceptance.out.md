TST-0012 is already present in `docs/constitution/30_testplan.md` with the required minimal-set fields and prohibited-items language, so no edits were needed. I verified the entry and ran CI.

- Verified required fields + prohibition statement in `docs/constitution/30_testplan.md:24`
- Verified observation command in `docs/constitution/30_testplan.md:25`

Tests:
- `./ci.sh` (green)
